# Setting up Isaac Sim

##Possible Routes

* Try remote deployment using SSH
* Try cloud deployment using AWS, Azure, GCP
* Try getting the VM to get access to the GPU on the computer


##Problems Encountered

* Azure free trial doesn't cover requirments for Isaac Sim
* Not all GCP regions have access to the Isaac Sim requirments (still in progress)
* AWS has the smallest free trial bundle so leaving that for last
* Waiting on BCIT for IP address of remote barnard computer to access using SSH

## What to do

* Contine trying Google Cloud Deployment
* Try remote deployment once BCIT responds
* Check with Nolan if the windows computer worked
