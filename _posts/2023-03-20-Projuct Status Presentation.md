### Project Background

<p style="text-align: center;">Bittle doing something cute!</p>

* Realistic locomotion in robots has been a long-standing challenge
* Robots with a high number of degrees of freedom and multiple sensors have had success with locomotion
* Robots like Bittle with only 8 degrees of freedom and fewer sensors have not yet been able to achieve the same success
* We aim to train the Bittle robot to walk using reinforcement learning

### Wins 
 
 ![Nividia's Isaac Sim](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/gtcf20/omniverse/refresh-open-beta/nvidia-omniverse-isaac-sim-icon-128.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

<p style="text-align: center;">NIVIDIA's Isaac Sim</p>

* Found out everything NIVIDIA's Isaac Sim doesn't work on
* Scoped out different simulators 
* Preparing algorithms to run once Isaac Sim is running

### Plans for the rest of the semester

* Run RL algorithms on Isaac Sim 
* Use transformers 

### Current Problems

* Still waiting on BCIT for the computer fix
